# Gender-gap-in-education-and-economic-growth
This seminar paper examines the impact of the educational gender gap on both economic growth and fertility rates, drawing data from the World Bank and employing panel data regression techniques. The analysis encompasses pooled OLS, fixed effects, and random effects models, alongside one and two-step system and difference GMM estimations with different lag structures.

The results indicate that, for model 1, the random effects model outperforms the fixed effects model, while for model 2, the reverse is true. However, pooled OLS is found to be a superior fit for both models when compared to random effects. Despite this, the effects observed are statistically insignificant.

Regarding GMM estimation, the system GMM demonstrates better performance, although the Hansen test complicates the selection of lags. Nonetheless, in the one-way system GMM estimation, two-thirds of lag estimations suggest a negative correlation between the educational gender gap and economic growth, while the opposite is true for two-way system GMM estimation.

In the case of difference GMM estimation, a positive correlation is observed between the educational gender gap and economic growth across all lag structures. Additionally, the paper finds a consistent negative correlation between the educational gender gap and fertility rates across various lag structures in both system and difference GMM estimations.
